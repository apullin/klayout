# KLayout performance worklist

This is the durable queue for the `perf` branch.  Update it whenever an item
is measured, accepted, rejected, or re-ranked.

## Current baseline and acceptance gate

- Workload: FreePDK45 `sram_1rw0r0w_64_1024_freepdk45_aref.gds`
- Binary: clang + full LTO, jemalloc, batch mode
- Accepted serial wall time: 128.68 s, 128.98 s; mean 128.83 s
- Process-sharded wall time: 69.78 s, 70.43 s, and 69.689 s through the
  packaged launcher; three-run mean 69.966 s
- Current end-to-end gain: **+84.1% throughput** versus the accepted serial
  mean, with 1.06% full-range spread.  The packaged run alone is +84.9%.
- Baseline raw report SHA-256:
  `e9340a8d3cf3608cff5f87fe5c82aa9b122c215627dc9159a3d59f98bcaaedd0`
- Path-normalized baseline and batched report SHA-256:
  `74e8e6bb6d46e8574bcb8cdf159fee32f52dd49c0f6997db44b2645648357ba9`
- Deterministic merged clean-report SHA-256:
  `c699e50f16d9f460d686191fcbfa6986ededbff96f416ebfd8d55cfdff8bf6b1`
- Shard-aware deck SHA-256:
  `5b05b599f5af878364365136248177b63098e92ff18287d097274f54500ee2ce`
- Deck-bound shard manifest SHA-256:
  `2f0e419ad63654b5cd6987b81662ed0b44b671f3f353f7a2a3dff4f7ef6949a3`
  (`decks/freepdk45-shards-bound.json` in the external corpus)
- Deterministic merged 99-marker fixture SHA-256:
  `9b55135453bbdd9a9a0c28b583bee73d89af20cd499978c052fa991b8d1919ef`
- Iteration target: 3–5 minutes; retain only exact, repeatable wins

## Ranked work

1. **Cross-PDK process sharding on domestic-micro blocks — next**
   Split the Sky130 DME1 and FP4/FP16 decks into measured rule groups, bootstrap
   strict manifests from their accepted reports, and confirm that the large
   FreePDK gain survives a different rule deck and non-OpenRAM hierarchy.
2. **Native bounded rule-DAG scheduler**
   Replace process duplication with an in-process API only after serially
   materializing mutable deep inputs and variants.  The process result proves
   CPU headroom but does not prove that a shared `DeepShapeStore` is safe.
3. **Incremental antenna edge replay — re-profile first**
   The old estimate assumed ten cumulative rebuilds.  Empty-target pruning
   removed six, so its present ceiling is much smaller and must be measured
   before implementation.
4. **Intra-cell parallelism for remaining deep checks**
   Subdivide the few large serial geometry operations that limit ordinary
   deck-level thread scaling.
5. **Lazy interpreter initialization**
   Reduce the roughly 1.4 s batch startup floor for short jobs; separate from
   long-run geometry work.

## Recently completed

- Empty-target antenna pruning: 161.38 s to 146.50 s, **+10.2% throughput**,
  byte-identical report; commit `0873912` on `perf`.
- Homogeneous multi-output compound DRC: batch the matching M1 and M2
  width/spacing checks into one deep traversal while preserving independent
  report categories.  146.50 s to 128.83 s mean, **+13.7% throughput**,
  path-normalized byte-identical report.  Direct M1 batch: 17.15–17.24 s;
  direct M2 batch: 3.95–4.04 s.
- Isolated process-level rule-DAG scheduling: a balanced `ACTIVE` + `METAL1`
  shard and an all-other-rules shard reduce 128.83 s to a 69.966 s mean,
  **+84.1% throughput**.  `scripts/run_parallel_drc.py` bounds and supervises
  child processes; `scripts/merge_sharded_lyrdb.py` bootstraps a strict
  category-order/ownership manifest and publishes an atomic deterministic
  report.  The clean workload has all 157 categories, and a hierarchical
  violation fixture has the exact 99-marker union (15 + 84), including full
  item payloads and cell references.  KLayout natively loads the merged output;
  merge overhead is 4 ms.  The manifest is bound to the shard-aware deck hash,
  so a mismatched deck fails before expensive children launch.  Nineteen
  focused launcher/merger tests cover success, failure, SIGTERM cleanup,
  atomic publication, permissions, nested categories, cell variants/reference
  order, cross-layout reuse, determinism, and nonempty payload preservation.

## Rejected or bounded prototypes

- Persistent hierarchy-context caching: context formation was only about
  12–14 s for the entire deck and the contexts contain mutable propagated
  results without a reliable `Shapes` revision token.  Do not revive this as
  a cross-rule cache without a real invalidation design.
- Disparate-rule batching: the aggregate uses the maximum interaction border
  and union of all external inputs.  Batch only rules with similar distance,
  metrics and inputs; unrelated rules can increase preprocessing work.
- M1 enclosure batching: even the apparently ideal pair
  `enclosing(cont, 35nm, projection)` + `enclosing(via1, 35nm, projection)`
  regressed.  The pair took 31.66 s batched versus 30.67 s separately, and the
  full run took 130.24 s versus the 128.83 s accepted mean (about 1.1% slower).
  The report remained exact.  The unioned secondary interactions outweighed
  any shared traversal, so do not revive this pair.
- Mixed hierarchy reducers: sequential reducer composition can under-specify
  variants.  The batch API rejects incompatible reducer combinations rather
  than risking incorrect rotated or magnified hierarchy reuse.

## Guardrails

- Do not disable or weaken rules.
- Preserve report geometry, categories, descriptions, and diagnostic outputs.
- Test both flat and deep modes when engine semantics are affected.
- Record rejected prototypes so they are not rediscovered after context rolls.
